# web3.unity Sample Project

This Unity project serves as a sample on how to use the `web3.unity` package.


To run this project, you must [obtain and configure a project ID](https://docs.gaming.chainsafe.io/current/project-id-registration).
Then, open the sample scene and drag one of the scripts in `Assets/Scripts/Samples` onto an empty game object.
Alternatively, you can drop in one of the prefabs in `Assets/Prefabs`.
Finally, open the Login scene and run the game.

Please note that this project references the web3.unity SDK package using a local path;
to use the package in your own projects, you must set up ChainSafe Gaming's registry and use the package identifier (`io.chainsafe.web3-unity`).
