## Notices

After **June 15, 2023** all users of the SDK will be required to have their projects registered. Please ensure that you have a valid project ID to avoid any service interruptions by this time. If you need help getting a project ID, we've put together a tutorial to guide you through the process: https://docs.gaming.chainsafe.io/current/project-id-registration.

As always, we're here to help, so feel free to message us in ⁠🕹web3unity-gaming-general  or ⁠🕹gaming-help if you're stuck and need help!

## Documentation
https://docs.gaming.chainsafe.io/

- Have a code contribution you'd like to make directly? Make a pull request to this repo!
- Join our community! Say hi on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q6A3YA2) in #web3unity-gaming-general and share your project built with web3.unity in #gaming-showcase.

## Building the code
- Clone the repository and run the `setup` script.
- You can now open `src/UnitySampleProject` in Unity and start hacking!
- Whenever you make changes to the code in the libraries, run the `src/ChainSafe.Gaming.Unity/publish-to-unity-package` script from within the folder it is in. This will build and publish the libraries to the UPM package's folder, thus making any new code accessible inside Unity.
